'******************** Failure Definitions ********************
'
'   The failure arrays (gintFailure and gintSevere) are
'   defined as two dimensional INTEGER arrays.  The first
'   index in the two dimensional array identifies each
'   output (i.e. channel number). The second index
'   identifies the failure for that channel (i.e. fault
'   number).  This structure allows expandability for
'   adding failures in a project.
'
'   It is also important to note that the data contained in
'   the first element (i.e. faultNum = 0) contains the total
'   number of failures for that channel.
'
'   Hence,
'   the syntax for the array definitions would be as follows:
'
'               gintFailure(chanNum, faultNum)
'               gintSevere (chanNum, faultNum)
'
'Examples:
'   This sets a high index failure on channel 1:
'
'           gintFailure(1, HIGHINDEXPT1) = True
'
'   While this clears a high index failure on channel 1:
'
'           gintFailure(1, HIGHINDEXPT2) = False

'NOTE(s):   The arrays defined for the modular user-defined types

'              NOTE:  A priority for failures is established by the order of
'                     the elseif's below, as only the first true statement
'                     will be executed.  This means that only the first

'                     will be equal to the total number of failures.
